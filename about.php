	  <p>Our templates are then coded by our dev team. Think of the templates as the app skeleton on which you can build you apps body.We cut up the .psd assets and put them into an app project, with all the views that you can see in the individual app videos. These template projects are coded in quality native code, Objective-C for iOS and Java for Android. They are not finished apps, they are just the UI views. But even this will save you many hours in development. 
 </p><br>

<p>All our templates will run on your simulator immediately, and can be build and run on your own iPhone/Android mobile device as soon as you download them.</p><br>

<p>Build iOS templates on your iPhone using Xcode from Apple, and Android templates in Eclipse ADT from Google. </p><br>

<p> They dont run on Android Studio, as its still in Beta.</p><br>

<p>They do not have backend databases or APIs, but are a fantastic start to building your finished app.</p>
